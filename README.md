# Daily Tasks

* Daily Tasks is a utility app that lets users list out daily to-dos and check them off a list.

* Whenever a user submits a task, it will display the task on the left side of the page.

* Each task in the waiting area also has a `Completed!` button. When the user clicks it, the task will move to the right side of the page.

* This app will store every task in a database, whether completed or not.
